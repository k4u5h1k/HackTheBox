- ran nmap 80 and 22 are open
- 80 has a login page that gives ssh key of logged in user. Default creds get me nowhere
- fuzzed site got an include folder with a vim swap file
- openned up the file and hit :recover to get file.
- strings on that file gave a string jennifer who seems to be the owner of the file.
- googled and found that openbsd login auth has a -s challenge option to force authentication
- however the user then becomes -s challenge which has no ssh key.
- so got a cookie editor and added a username field with username jennifer.
- got ssh key of jennifer. Got user
- most recent exploit of openbsd root66 (in this directory) that gives me root.
