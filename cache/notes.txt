- nmap said 22 and 80
- 80 had a website with login
- Seemed like login was checked without sending form ie the script had to be somewhere local
- Indeed found a script only validating if username was ash and password H@v3_fun
- logged in found nothing
- in the contact page of author in cache.htb there was a reference to a hospital management system
- so used hms.htb to go to that site
- there was a cms called on openemr v5.0.1.3
- found sql injection used sqlmap to exploit
- got hash of openemr_admin which john said was xxxxxx 
- logged in as openemr_admin
- stole cookies whenever required from here
- another exploit let me upload files, naturally uploaded reverse shell 
- request used was,

- navigated to http://hms.htb/portal/payload.php to download reverse shell and then http://hms.htb/portal/php-reverse-shell.php to get reverse shell
- got in as www-data 
- to get better shell ran python ptty then su as ash using H@v3_fun found before
- then ran netstat -tulpn to find services running and one was higher up in 11211 called memcached (fitting)
- memcached stores data in 'slabs'
- accessed like this
stats cachedump 1 0 <<<< command
stats cachedump 1 0

- So we got luffy with password 0n3_p1ec3
- su as him 
- he could run docker and the machine seemed to have ubuntu image
- ran gtfobin with docker and got root
    docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it ubuntu chroot /mnt sh
root:$6$bWa.Lbnz$k0KbMyNbdOQRcY5pWuHM2bfkF5ek8c0CTNsi00qFHmp04NqcefCsIXZTdJgqToRar5zcEk5k8KFhbIomGB3Kb/:18178:0:99999:7:::
