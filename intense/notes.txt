- Website said you can log in with guest and guest
- got some website code
- found sql injection in submit
- test'||(case when (select count(secret) from users where username='guest')=1 then NULL else load_extension(0) end));-- 
- now must script bruteforcing character by character
- wrote script and found secret f1fc12010c094016def791e1435ddfdcaeccf8250e36630c0bc93285c2971105
- now must forge cookie
- first part of cookie is the base64 of user=username;secret=secret
- second part of the cookie is the base64(sha256(private key + first part without base64))
- so must use hash extension attack so that i can add another username;secret at the end and fool the system into thinking those are my valid creds
- wrote a script to do this and called it cook.py
- give it the second part of the cookie as first argument and key length in second
- copy paste the output cookie and you should be set
- so got admin
- admin could use the /admin/log/view and /admin/log/dir to send file and folder names in post request to view files and folders
- had to add Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded header to make it recognize that there is data in the body
- so could use standard lfi payload ../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd to get file
- coded a custom shell and named it cosecsfilegetter.py
- if there is a / at the end of name, it ls'es the name else cat
- ight
